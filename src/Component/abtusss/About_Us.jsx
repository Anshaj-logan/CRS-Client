        <p>
        KR's Sree Narayana College is one of the premier institutions run under the aegis of KR's Sree Narayana Educational Trust, Thozhuvanoor, Valanchery.
        This institution is a sister concern of KR Bakes, a familiar brand name in the bakery field which has completed 47 years since its inception in 1969.
        The enviable growth of KR Bakes is attributed to the uncompromising and relentless attitude of the management regarding quality and technological up
         gradation. Taking lessons from the bakery business that if quality is not compromised, there would be demand for the product, the management of KR 
         Bakes has decided to carry forward their legacy of the bakery business into the field of higher education by starting an Arts and Science college at 
         Thozhuvanoor, Valanchery, one of the educationally backward areas of Kerala. Though there is no lack of educational institutions in Malappuram District,
         there is not even a handful of institutions which provide quality education to students. KR's Sree Narayana Educational Trust right from the beginning is
         trying to overcome this hurdle by providing quality education. The commitment and vision of the management is seen in all aspects including infrastructure,
